Method.                                                     The algorithm:
Put soap water into mixing bowl.                            We first set up some constants and variables.
Remove soap water from mixing bowl.                         Now theres 0 in the mixing bowl

Put wholemeal spelt flour into mixing bowl.                 Again, 0 in the mixing bowl,
Mix well.                                                   this does nothing,
Remove mixer from mixing bowl.                              now there's -1 in the MB,
Fold wholemeal rye flour into mixing bowl.                  which gets stored into wholemeal rye flour.

Insert the grain of sugar.                                  and start a loop where it gets decremented in every iteration.
Put fifty grams of butter into mixing bowl.                 We do the same thing with the y position.
Fold drop of water into mixing bowl.

Add eight grams of cacao to mixing bowl.                    and add that to the square of x.
Stir fifty grams of butter into the mixing bowl.            (This line is only needed for actually baking and does noting.)
Fold fifty grams of sugar into mixing bowl.                 So the result of that - x^2+y^2 - is stored in our sugar. In a moment, we want to get the square root of it.
Put wholemeal spelt flour into mixing bowl.                 We now need to handle the case of x^2+y^2=0, because the division later will otherwise break the program. We first put it into the MB
Insert the fifty grams of sugar.                            and now test if it's zero.
Fold wholemeal spelt flour into mixing bowl.                 If it isn't, we may continue to take the square root, so we remove the zero value from the MB again.
Put twohundret grams of wheat flour into mixing bowl.        We will need the constant 2 in a second.
Put baking powder into mixing bowl.                          First we put the number of iterations into the MB
Fold eight grams of cacao into mixing bowl.                  and set the control variable to its value.
Insert the eight grams of cacao.                             We then initiate the loop.
Fold nothing into mixing bowl.                                Now we set our square root approximation to two. This is arbitrary.
Put fifty grams of sugar into mixing bowl.                    We put x^2+y^2 into the MB
Divide nothing into mixing bowl.                              and divide it by our approximation.

Fold fifty grams of sugar into mixing bowl.                  and set sugar to it
Do until inserted.                                          to break the loop (because it was never intended to be a loop, but rather an if-Statement).
Fold nothing into mixing bowl.                              The effect of this line depends on the "if" above: if x^2+y^2 was zero, then our approximation to the difference of the square from the (0,0)-corner correctly gets set to zero. If it wasn't, it gets set to the last approximation we produced in the loop above.
Put nothing into mixing bowl.                               Now we put our approximation into the MB.
Combine wholemeal rye flour into mixing bowl.               We multiply it by -1
Add fifty grams of butter to mixing bowl.                   and add the sidelength to get the difference.
Fold nothing into mixing bowl.                              We store the result in "nothing".
Do the nothing.                                             If the difference is positive, meaning that the small square we are working on in the moment has a distance less than the sidelength from the corner, we execute the following lines, which increment the counter, else we skip them.
Put egg into 2nd mixing bowl.                               We put the counter in the MB,
Add vanilla custard powder to 2nd mixing bowl.              add one
Fold egg into 2nd mixing bowl.                              and store the result back into the counter.
Set aside.                                                  This breaks the loop (which again is an if-statement).
Proceed until doed.                                         End of the if.
Put hands into mixing bowl.                                 The following lines are only needed for actual cooking. We need something in the MB, so we put 2 in,
