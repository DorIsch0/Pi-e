# Making the actual pie

The first thing to do was getting all the ingredients. Luckily, I found a pipette I could use to measure the drops of water needed.

I began by cleaning the mixing bowl, as the recipe expected me to do.

Mixing extremely small amounts of ingredients together wasn't the most pleasurable experience, inserting individual grains of sugar or drops of water however was rather fun.

Somewhere along the way I realised that it would take much longer than I expected, because I had to add small amounts of ingredients over and over again. Finally I was ready to mix the main dough and put it into the baking dish.

When I finally had the filling ready, it was a nice experience from there. The cake turned out nice.

I then used some cardboard to cut out a pi-symbol, which I used to sprinkle powdered sugar around it.

It was finally time to approximate pi using the real pie: I took a measuring tape and measured the cake's circumference (84.7cm) and diameter (26.5cm), giving me an approximation of about 3.196, which is about as good as executing the program with a value of fifty grams of butter=100.

Oh and by the way, the cake was delicious.
